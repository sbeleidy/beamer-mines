# beamer-mines

Beamer theme for the Colorado School of Mines.


## How to use

Clone or copy the `beamercolorthememines.sty` file into your TeX directory or project then in your beamer project use:

```LaTeX
\usecolortheme{mines}
```

## What you need

Make sure you have LaTeX installed.

Make sure you install the [Montserrat fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat).

You'll need to use `xelatex` not `pdflatex` for compilation due to the use of the fontspec package. The settings.json file in this repo can be used with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and the [LaTeX workshop plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop) for the workspace or user settings.
